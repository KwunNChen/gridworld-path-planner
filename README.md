# gridworld-path-planner
## A grid-based world with obstacles, where an agent finds a path from a start cell to a goal using BFS.

The project is being split up into separate parts:
1) Object-Oriented Programming for multiple instances, and easier organization                             
2) Create a Grid class for visualization, and create helper methods. (world.py)
3) Create a Breadth First Search (BFS) class to find a path to the end. (BFS_pathfinder.py)
4) Create user input, and potentially a GUI
