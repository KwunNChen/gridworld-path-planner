# gridworld-path-planner
## A grid-based world with obstacles, where an agent finds a path from a start cell to a goal using Breadth First Search (BFS)

The project is being split up into separate parts:

---------------------------------------------------IMPLEMENTATION PHASE---------------------------------------------------
1) First, I have created a class that creates the actual grid, and checks if each spot allows for the agent to move
2) Second, I allowed the user to create a start and end goal in the form of a tuple. If the user inputs an illegal tuple, the start and end cells will be randomized. I then imported deque and utilized its functionality to implement BFS.
3) Thirdly, I added some ASCII text in order to make the programn look better for the implementation phase. This is a separate class because I wanted to keep each step of the code organized.
4) Lastly for the implementation, I put together all three classes and asked the user for input. This program will continue to repeat until the user types "n", in which the program will halt.

---------------------------------------------------FRONTEND PHASE---------------------------------------------------
5) Being brutally honest here, I have little to no experience with front-end work. So I'll be learning how to create something that looks bareable to look at. Stay tuned for more after Christmas!
