# gridworld-path-planner
## A grid-based world with obstacles, where an agent finds a path from a start cell to a goal using BFS.

The project is being split up into separate parts:
1) Object-Oriented Programming for multiple instances if need be                                
2) Create grids with custom sizes (square), and custom obstacle_counts
3) Replace each numerical value with special characters for viewability (0 = ., 1 = #)
4) Utilize Breadth First Search (BFS) to find a path to the end.
